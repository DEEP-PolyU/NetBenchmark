## Objective

We aim at building a auto,fair and systematic evaluation platform to compare the results of different Network Embedding models. 
The implemented or modified models include [DeepWalk](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk), 
[LINE](https://github.com/tangjianpku/LINE), [node2vec](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec), 
[GraRep](https://github.com/ShelsonCao/GraRep), [TADW](https://github.com/thunlp/TADW), 
[GCN](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn), NetMF, GAE, featWalk, CAN and DGI. 

We will implement more representative NE models continuously. 
Specifically, we welcome other researchers to contribute NE models into this platform.
